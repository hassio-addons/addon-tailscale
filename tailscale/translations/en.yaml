configuration:
  advertise_exit_node:
    name: Advertise as an exit node
    description: >-
      This option allows you to advertise this Tailscale instance as an exit node.
      By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
      route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  log_level:
    name: Log level
    description: >-
      Controls the level of log details the add-on provides.
      This only applies to the add-on itself, not Tailscale.
  login_server:
    name: Login server
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify a custom control server for this
      Tailscale instance, for example, a self-host Headscale instance.
      By default, it uses the control server provided by Tailscale.
  tags:
    name: Tags
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this
      Tailscale instance. They need to start with `tag:`.
  taildrop:
    name: Taildrop
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Taildrop, a file sharing service
      that allows you to share files with other Tailscale nodes.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
