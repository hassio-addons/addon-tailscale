# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Tailscale

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Create a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances.
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this add-on, you'll need a Tailscale account.

It is free to use for personal & hobby projects, up to 20 clients/devices on a
single user account. Sign up using your Google, Microsoft or GitHub account at
the following URL:

<https://login.tailscale.com/start>

You can also create an account during the add-on installation processes,
however, it is nice to know where you need to go later on.

## Installation

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Start the "Tailscale" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Tailscale" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the **Web UI** of the "Tailscale" add-on to complete authentication and
   couple your Home Assistant instance with your Tailscale account.

   **Note:** _Some browsers don't work with this step. It is recommended to
   complete this step on a desktop or laptop computer using the Chrome browser._

1. Done!

## Configuration

This add-on has almost no additional configuration options for the
add-on itself.

However, when logging in to Tailscale, you can configure your Tailscale
network right from their interface.

<https://login.tailscale.com/>

The add-on exposes "Exit Node" capabilities that you can enable from your
Tailscale account. Additionally, if the Supervisor managed your network (
which is the default), the add-on will also advertise routes to your
subnet to Tailscale.

```yaml
tags:
  - tag:example
  - tag:homeassistant
cert_domain: tail9999.ts.net
```

### Option: `tags`

This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this Tailscale
instance. They need to start with `tag:`.

More information: <https://tailscale.com/kb/1068/acl-tags/>

### Option: `cert_domain`

This option (if set) configures tailscale to provision TLS certificates. The format is the same as for `tailscale cert <your-domain>`. It's necessary to set the exact domain under which your Home-Assistant instance is running.

1. Go to [DNS tab](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) in Tailscale's admin page
2. Choose a **Tailnet name** and click **Enable HTTPS** under HTTPS Certificates
3. Find your Home-Assistant in the [Machines tab](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) and note under which name your device is reachable
4. Your device should now be reachable under `https://<device-name>.<tailnet-domain-alias>.ts.net` (but with an invalid ssl certificate)
5. Go to the **Configuration tab** of this add-on and set the above domain at `cert_domain:` (only the domain, without the machine name)
6. Restart the add-on, you should now have two new files under `/ssl/tailscale` which you can use to configure any webserver
7. Visit again the above domain, you should have now a valid ssl certificate (if you encounter strange browser behaviour or strange error messages, try to clear all site related cookies, clear all browser cache, restart browser)

See [Enabling HTTPS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https/) for more information.

<details>
<summary><b>Note:</b> This add-on only downloads the Tailscale certificate, but you have to configure a webserver to use it. Some basic configuration examples: (Click to expand!)</summary>

- Your Tailscale connection is only a backup connection (eg. CGNAT-ed mobile internet USB stick) to access Home Assistant

  - Home Assistant uses another certificate generated by eg. the Duck DNS or the Let's Encrypt add-ons
  - No Tailscale certificate is generated, you are not using this option
  - Using eg. `https://<...>.duckdns.org` url the browser **will not** give you a `Not secure` warning
  - Using `https://<...>.ts.net` url the browser **will** give you a `Not secure` warning

- Your Tailscale connection is your main connection to access Home Assistant

  - Home Assistant uses the certificate generated by this add-on
  - Using `https://<...>.ts.net` url the browser **will not** give you a `Not secure` warning

- There are multiple connections to access Home Assistant
  - Home Assistant **doesn't** use any certificate, just plain http access
  - You need eg. the NGINX Home Assistant SSL proxy add-on to use the specific ceriticates for each connection
  - For all the urls the browser **will not** give you a `Not secure` warning
